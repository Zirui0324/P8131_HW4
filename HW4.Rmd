### QUESTION 1

#### Pair-wise associations 1) contact with other residents:

```{r}
mar_con = margin.table(housing, margin=c(1, 3))
prop.table(mar_con, margin = 1)
```
#### Pair-wise associations 2) type of housing:

```{r}
mar_type = margin.table(housing, margin=c(2, 3))
prop.table(mar_type, margin = 1)
```
